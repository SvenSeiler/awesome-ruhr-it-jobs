[Awesome Ruhr IT Jobs](https://giftkugel.github.io/awesome-ruhr-it-jobs/)

A curated list of employers for software developers and technology freaks in the German Ruhr area. :blush:

## Why?
Before I joined the awesome [Karakun AG](https://dev.karakun.com), I was looking for possible employers in the German Ruhr area. I collected a bunch of links of nice companies. This list has become stale in my browser and many colleagues asked for it. Now I decided to create an awesome list to allow colleagues looking for a job do find one!

## Contribute
It's a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based application. All data is stored in `data.js`. If you want to add a company, just create a pull request on `data.js`.

## Get a nice job!
Have fun finding a good job! :smiley:

Share this list on Twitter, or somewhere else,, so more persons can get the list and get the right job!
